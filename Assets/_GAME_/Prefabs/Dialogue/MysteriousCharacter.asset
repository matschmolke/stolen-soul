  - Hello.
  - You are free.
  - You might feel a little lost right now and not really know what's going on.
  - So let me summarize it for you.
  - The wizard threw you into this dungeon and took the orb that contains your memories.
  - "To get them back, you\u2019ll have to reach his fortress."
  - "But before that, you\u2019ll need to fight his minions."
  - "You do remember how to fight\u2026 don\u2019t you?"
  - Press the left mouse button to attack.
  - Pressing the appropriate number key will trigger your magic attack. It fires
    toward your mouse cursor.
  - Just remember, all magic uses mana.
  - So drink beer when your mana gets low.
  - And lastly, press E to open your inventory.
  - Good luck.
